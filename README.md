## Introduction
The airline industry faces ongoing challenges in maintaining passenger satisfaction, influenced by factors such as delays, service quality, and operational inefficiencies. Dissatisfied customers can lead to negative reviews, reduced brand loyalty, and financial losses. This project leverages predictive analytics to identify key factors affecting customer satisfaction and develop models to predict and improve the passenger experience. By applying data mining algorithms, we aim to uncover insights that will help airlines optimize operations, reduce delays, and enhance customer service. Ultimately, our findings will support data-driven decisions that improve the overall passenger experience, which is vital for long-term business sustainability.
### Background:
Passenger satisfaction is a critical metric for airlines, as it directly impacts customer loyalty, brand reputation, and revenue. The industry is continually grappling with factors such as flight delays, service quality, and varying levels of comfort, all of which contribute to a customer’s overall experience. In an increasingly competitive market, airlines need to leverage data to enhance operational efficiency, improve onboard services, and manage delays effectively. This project builds upon existing data science methodologies to apply predictive modeling and data exploration techniques to a dataset from the airline industry, aiming to derive actionable insights for improving customer satisfaction.

### Dataset Summary and Preparation
The dataset we used for the project is Airline_passanger_satisfaction dataset from Kaggle to analyse the trends about the customer satisfaction by their reviews. This dataset contains 129,880 records with 24 columns, including categorical and numerical features. The key variables include passenger demographics (Gender, Age, Customer Type), flight details (Flight Distance, Departure/Arrival Delay, Travel Type, Class), and satisfaction-related ratings (Cleanliness, Seat Comfort, Online Boarding, etc.). The target variable is Satisfaction, which is either Satisfied or Neutral or Dissatisfied.

### Data Preparation:
Handling Missing Values: The only column with missing values is Arrival Delay (129,487 non-null values). To make the dataset more valuable, we handled it by using mean () to handle the missing values.
Cleaning: For any project, dataset cleaning is the first and foremost activity; to make this happen we performed all the basic cleaning works on the data. For which, we checked for missing values, outliers and handled the data and make it suitable for project analysis.
Feature selections: We selected the features by using Filter Selection with ANOVA. The selected features are: "Type of Travel" and "Class" directly influence expectations and service experiences. "Flight Distance" affects overall journey comfort, and "Online Boarding" reflects the convenience of the check-in process. "On-board Service," "Seat Comfort," and "Leg Room Service" contribute to the in-flight experience, which are also crucial for satisfaction. "Cleanliness" is a key hygiene factor, and "In-flight Wi-Fi Service" and "In-flight Entertainment" enhance the overall travel experience. These selected features provide a comprehensive view of customer experience, making them valuable for predicting satisfaction levels in our analysis.

## Data Exploration
### 1.Correlation between satisfaction and selected features

Based on our previous features selection, we selected following top10 features from all the dependent variables to predict customer satisfaction: Online Boarding, Type of Travel, Class, In-flight Entertainment, Seat Comfort, Leg Room Service, On-board Service, Flight Distance, Cleanliness, and In-flight Wifi Service. We plotted the correlation from the selected features above(Figure 1&2), the Correlation scores reveal critical factors that impact passenger satisfaction.

The correlation analysis highlights key factors influencing passenger satisfaction, with digital processes and service-related features playing an essential role. Online Boarding (r = 0.508) stands out as the most significant factor, emphasizing the importance of digital check-in and boarding experience. As travelers increasingly prioritize convenience, airlines should focus on enhancing automated check-in systems, biometric boarding, and mobile app early check in to reduce wait times and long que at the airport. Service expectations also have a major impact, with Type of Travel (r = 0.487) and Class (r = 0.472) ranking as the second most influential factors. This indicates that premium travelers place a higher value on exclusivity, comfort, and priority services. Business-class and frequent flyers expect premium experiences, such as personalized customer care, exclusive lounge access, and expedited boarding. To fulfill these expectations, airlines should differentiate their premium offerings, ensuring enhanced service quality that drives higher revenue and customer retention in this lucrative segment. Beyond digital convenience and service tiers, the in-flight experience remains a critical determinant of satisfaction. Factors such as In-flight Entertainment (r = 0.390), Seat Comfort (r = 0.346), and Leg Room Service (r = 0.313) highlight that cabin amenities directly influence the perceived travel experience. Nowadays travelers, especially those on long distance and hours flights expect developed and full content entertainment systems, seating, and extra legroom for enhanced comfort. Investing in entertainment options, improved seat configurations, and personalized in-flight experiences can significantly elevate overall satisfaction and passenger loyalty.

Operational service elements also contribute to the satisfaction for flight passengers. Even with a slightly lower in correlation, On-board Service (r = 0.307), Cleanliness (r = 0.297), and In-flight WiFi Service (r = 0.278) remain essential components of the passenger experience in flight. Notably, the rising demand for in-flight WiFi suggests that airlines should prioritize offering reliable, high-speed connectivity and affordably price to meet travelers' digital expectations. Furthermore, onboard cabin crew performance and overall hospitality continue to shape customer perceptions, reinforcing the importance of continuous training and service enhancements. An interesting thing noticed from the analysis is the correlation between Flight Distance (r = 0.304) and satisfaction, which ranks higher than cleanliness. This suggests that long distance travelers prioritize comfort and additional amenities more than short distance passengers. To better accommodate long distance flyers, airlines should consider enhancing meal services, additional legroom options, and onboard entertainment contents, ensuring a more comfortable and enjoyable journey in a long flight.

### 2.Class and Travel Purpose
Business Class demonstrates the highest average satisfaction score (0.73), highlighting the effectiveness of premium amenities and services in meeting passengers’ expectations. Features such as spacious seating, superior meal options, priority check-in, and personalized customer service contribute significantly to customer satisfaction. An and Noh (2009) investigated the impact of in-flight service quality on airline customer satisfaction and loyalty in the airline industry suggests that comfort, exclusivity, and high-quality service are primary drivers of customer retention and brand loyalty in premium cabins. In contrast, Economy Class (0.20) and Economy Plus (0.26) report significantly lower satisfaction levels. It could be due to the disparities of seating comfort, in-flight entertainment, and customer service from business class (Park, Lee &Nicolau, 2020). Even though they may not expect Business Class luxuries, but with small and cost-effective enhancements such as extra legroom, digital entertainment options, and improved food variety and quality could potentially make a notable impact on customer perceptions and repeat business towards budget travellers. In another words, Airline companies should look to service and infrastructure improvements in Economy class while maintaining the high standards of premium services in Business Class.

Not only the type of class impacts the satisfaction levels, travel purpose also notably vary a gap in customer’s satisfaction. Business travelers report a relatively high average satisfaction score (0.63), suggesting that their expectations focus on punctuality, convenience, and reliability which means when these needs are met, satisfaction is high even if the trip isn’t perfect. (Global Business Travel Association, n.d.). Moreover, Business travel is often managed through corporate travel programs that negotiate favorable rates, prioritize efficient booking, and offer dedicated support. Conversely, personal travelers have a significantly lower satisfaction score (0.11), highlights a need to cater more effectively to leisure travelers as individuals may value flexibility, affordability and travel experience.

With our findings, since satisfaction with personal travel remains notably low, prioritizing specialized offers to leisure travelers is essential. This could involve introducing family-friendly packages, discounts on partner hotels or car rentals, and flexible ticketing options for those who prioritize travel experience and affordability. Additionally, expanding loyalty programs that reward frequent personal travelers with points or miles toward future flights can foster repeat business and improve their overall perception of value. As for business travelers, enhancing operational efficiency may benefit to higher satisfaction since as business travelers value their time. Ensuring reliable service support, expedited check-ins, and punctual flights will help sustain their already high satisfaction levels. It is significant to continuously gather feedback through surveys from frequent business traveler because they will provide valuable insights which allowing the company to refine their services and ensuring competitiveness in the business travellers market.

### 3.Flight Distance and Cleanliness

To analyze how flight distance affects passenger satisfaction, we can compute the average flight distance for Satisfied vs. Neutral or Dissatisfied passengers. A boxplot (Figure 4) that can show the distribution of flight distances by satisfaction level and then we checked if longer flights correlate with higher or lower satisfaction. The boxplot shows that satisfied passengers tend to have a wider range of flight distances. Longer flights may have a higher proportion of satisfied passengers, possibly due to better services on longer routes. There are significant outliers, indicating a few extremely long flights.

To explore the impact of Cleanliness on satisfaction, we can summarize average cleanliness ratings for each satisfaction level. A bar plot above (Figure 5) illustrates the distribution of cleanliness ratings between Satisfied and Neutral or Dissatisfied groups and correlation analysis can check how strongly cleanliness is associated with overall satisfaction. The plot shows that higher cleanliness ratings correlate with higher satisfaction. Most dissatisfied passengers rate cleanliness lower, while satisfied passengers tend to give higher cleanliness scores. This suggests that cleanliness is an important factor in overall passenger satisfaction.

### 4.Onboard Service and Comfortableness
Passenger satisfaction is closely tied to the quality of onboard services such as in-flight wifi, entertainment, seat comfort, and legroom service. These factors play a crucial role in shaping the overall customer experience and loyalty. The interactive box plot (Figure 6) visualizes how passengers rate various onboard services across different satisfaction levels (Dissatisfied, Neutral, Satisfied). The plot breaks down the ratings for each service feature and provides insights into their distribution. The spread of the data (from lower to upper fences) indicates the variability in passenger experiences, while the median and quartile values highlight the central tendency of ratings, allowing airlines to identify areas that consistently meet passenger expectations and areas that require improvement.

#### In-flight Wifi Service: 
For this feature, the box plot shows that the majority of satisfied passengers rate the service at the highest level (5). The upper fence is at 5, indicating that most ratings for wifi
are on the higher end. The median is 4, meaning many passengers rate it somewhat positively, though not all are completely satisfied. The lower fence at 0 suggests that some passengers may experience major dissatisfaction with wifi, potentially indicating sporadic or poor service.
#### In-flight Entertainment: 
The plot shows that the upper fence for satisfied passengers is also at 5, but the ratings range more widely. The lower quartile (Q1) starts at 3, with some passengers rating the entertainment quality as average, while the minimum rating drops to 1, indicating a small number of passengers found the entertainment unsatisfactory. This variability in ratings suggests inconsistent experiences with the entertainment options.
#### In-flight Legroom Service: 
The ratings for seat comfort and legroom are mostly high among satisfied passengers, with medians around 4. However, the upper quartile (Q3) and upper fence values are not fully specified, which makes it harder to compare with other features. The overall distribution suggests a generally positive experience, though some passengers may feel the legroom is insufficient.
#### On-board Service: 
The ratings for onboard service show a mix of satisfaction levels. The median for satisfied passengers is at 4, with the upper quartile (Q3) and upper fence at 5, indicating high ratings from the majority of satisfied passengers. However, the lower quartile (Q1) is at 3, and the lower fence is at 1, which suggests that some passengers felt the onboard service was inadequate, possibly due to delays or poor service quality from staff.
#### Online Boarding: 
Ratings for online boarding show that most passengers rate this service positively, with a median of 4. The upper fence is at 5, indicating high satisfaction from many passengers, but the lower fence starts at 3, suggesting there are areas for improvement in the online boarding process, such as wait times or system errors.
#### Seat Comfort: 
The ratings for seat comfort show a relatively consistent positive experience, with most satisfied passengers rating it highly (5). However, the lower fence starts at 3, indicating that there are some passengers who find the seats less comfortable, which could be due to factors such as seat size or design.

### 5.Operational Efficiency
The box plot (Figure 7) for visually compares how satisfaction levels vary with different departure delay times, providing insights into the relationship between delay and passenger satisfaction.
Figure 7
Dissatisfied passengers tend to experience longer delays, with a higher median departure delay, suggesting that significant delays negatively impact satisfaction. Neutral passengers have more moderate delays, while Satisfied passengers experience shorter delays, which correlates with better satisfaction levels. This visualization highlights that minimizing departure delays is crucial for improving passenger satisfaction, as timely departures directly influence the overall customer experience.
The Arrival Delay vs. Satisfaction box plot similarly illustrates the impact of arrival delays on passenger satisfaction. Passengers who are Dissatisfied generally experience longer arrival delays, with a higher median value, indicating that delays upon arrival significantly contribute to dissatisfaction. Neutral passengers show more variability in arrival delays, while Satisfied passengers experience the shortest delays, which align with higher satisfaction levels. This suggests that timely arrivals are equally important in maintaining customer satisfaction, as longer delays upon reaching the destination can lead to dissatisfaction. Addressing both departure and arrival delays is essential for improving the overall travel experience.

## Predictive Modelling
### 1.Logistic Regression
Figure 8
Based on the output (Figure 8) from the python code, the logistic regression model indicates a strong predictive performance, with overall accuracy at 82.92%. The confusion matrix reveals that the model correctly classified 11,287 true negatives and 11,110 true positives. However, the model misclassified 2,768 as false positives and 2,280 as false negatives, indicating that there is potential for improvement in specificity and sensitivity. The classification report shows that the model has a accuracy 86% for class 0 (negative identifications) as against 80% for class 1 (positive identifications), while recall rates exhibited a reverse pattern at 81% and 85%,. The harmonic F1-measure of 83% is an indicator of good balance between the measures for both classes. ROC curve analysis also provided an AUC of 0.91, which means the regression model effectively distinguish the target classes. Although these findings confirm the diagnostic validity of the model, strategic calibration to minimize Type I (false positive) and Type II (false negative) errors would also improve operational reliability.

### 2.Decision Tree
Figure 9
From the Decision Tree classifier, the model achieved an accuracy of 91.94%, demonstrating an improvement over the previously obtained Logistic Regression model (Figure 9). The classification report indicates that precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes are 92% or higher, suggesting a well-balanced model performance. Noticeably, class 0 exhibits a precision of 92% and a recall of 93%, while class 1 achieves a precision of 92% and a recall of 91%, resulting in an overall F1-score of 92%. Additionally, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is 0.92, indicating strong discriminative capability between the two classes. In comparison to the Logistic Regression model, the Decision Tree classifier demonstrates a better performance in terms of accuracy and classification metrics.

### 3.Random Forest
Figure 10
The Random Forest Classifier (Figure 10) shows a stronger predictive performance, with provided classification report and ROC curve. The model attains an overall accuracy of 93.52%, with high precision, recall, and F1-scores across both classes. Specifically, for class 0, the precision is 0.93, recall is 0.95, and the F1-score is 0.94, while for class 1, the precision is 0.94, recall is 0.92, and the F1-score is 0.93. The model’s balanced performance across both classes is further reinforced by a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.93. Additionally, the ROC curve provides further insights into the classifier’s capability, with an Area Under the Curve core of 0.91. This indicates a strong ability to distinguish between the two classes while effectively minimizing both false positives and false negatives. Compared to the previous models, the Random Forest Classifier demonstrates superior classification performance, achieving higher accuracy and a higher AUC score of 0.91.

### 4.KNN
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model is a simple yet powerful classification algorithm that makes predictions based on the majority class of the k-nearest data points. In this case, we trained the KNN model with k = 5, which yielded an accuracy of approximately 85.6%. The confusion matrix shows that the model is performing well, with fewer misclassifications for both classes (0 and 1). For class 0, the model correctly identified 13,398 instances, while it misclassified 1,557 as class 1. For class 1, 10,638 instances were correctly predicted, with 2,502 misclassified as class 0.
Figure 11
Figure 12

The classification report (Figure 11) further highlights the model’s effectiveness, with a precision of 0.84 for class 0 and 0.87 for class 1, and an overall F1-score of 0.86, indicating a balanced performance across both classes. To optimize the model, we explored different values of k, ranging from 1 to 20, using cross-validation to evaluate accuracy. The plot (Figure 12) showed multiple peaks, with k = 5 providing the highest accuracy, while other values of k such as 3 and 7 also performed well. However, after k = 7, the accuracy steadily declined, suggesting that higher values of k lead to diminishing returns in model performance. This process of tuning k helps ensure that the model is neither overfitting nor underfitting the data. In this case, our best KNN model is when k = 5 will be the best for predicting passenger satisfaction which we use to train above.

### 5.Neural Network Model
Figure 13
Predicting passenger satisfaction is crucial for the airline industry to enhance customer experience and service quality. This project utilizes a neural network model to classify passenger satisfaction based on various features such as flight distance, cleanliness, seat comfort, and other service-related factors. The dataset was preprocessed and scaled to improve model performance, followed by training a deep learning model to achieve optimal classification accuracy. Before training the neural network model. The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. The neural network model was implemented, where the architecture included: Input Layer: Accepting feature vectors of shape (X_train_scaled.shape[1],). Hidden Layers: Two fully connected layers with ReLU activation:128 neurons in the first layer with a dropout rate of 0.2 and 64 neurons in the second layer with a dropout rate of 0.2. Output Layer: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

The trained model was evaluated using accuracy, precision-recall curves, confusion matrix (Figure 16), and classification reports. For the accuracy on test set, the model achieved a classification accuracy of Sequential Neural Network Test Accuracy on the test dataset (Figure 13). And worked on Confusion Matrix Analysis and Precision-Recall Curve, indicated how well the model distinguishes between satisfied and dissatisfied passengers.
Figure 14
Figure 15& 16
Figure 17
Thus, in the evaluation of a neural network model to predict passenger satisfaction. The classification report indicates that the Sequential Neural Network model achieved an overall accuracy of 94% on the test set (Figure 17). Based on Figure 13, the precision and recall scores for both classes (satisfied and unsatisfied passengers) are high, with class 0 (unsatisfied passengers) having a recall of 96% and class 1 (satisfied passengers) having a recall of 92%. The F1-scores of 0.95 and 0.94 suggest a well-balanced model with strong predictive performance. The precision curve (Figure 15) starts at high precision (1.0) and decreases linearly as recall increases. The linear decrease suggests consistent degradation in performance. whereas the trends show both loss and accuracy metrics over 25 epochs. The loss graph (Figure 14) shows a steady decrease from ~0.23 to ~0.14 and Accuracy increases from ~0.905 to ~0.94. Thus, both training and validation curves follow similar patterns with minimal gap, indicating good model fit (no obvious overfitting). These results suggest that deep learning can effectively classify customer experiences in the airline industry. Further improvements could include hyperparameter tuning, more complex architectures, or additional feature engineering to enhance prediction accuracy. This model achieved the best accuracy among all the model we have been tested. With the high accuracy in predicting satisfaction this model is highly recommended for further decision making and marketing strategies.

### 6.Summary
Figure 18
In our analysis, we conducted five different machine learning models to identify which one is the most accurate in predicting passenger satisfaction. The models tested include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Neural Network. From the bar chart above (Figure 18), it demonstrates the accuracies of the five models we have tested.
The Neural Network performed the best, achieving an accuracy of 94.18%. This indicates that it is highly effective at capturing complex patterns in the data, making it the most reliable model for predicting passengers’ satisfaction.
Follow by the next is the Random Forest model which is slightly lower to the Neural Network model with 93.52% accuracy. However, it is easier to interpret compared to Neural Networks. Therefore, if a balance between accuracy and interpretability is needed, Random Forest is a strong choice.
The Decision Tree model ranked the 3rd place, obtained 91.94% accuracy. Its performance is not bad, but it may suffer from overfitting which could struggle to make accurate predictions on new data.

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model had a lower accuracy of 85.52%. KNN works well for smaller datasets but is less efficient and less accurate in larger datasets. Thus, it may not be the best choice for predicting passenger satisfaction in a large dataset.
Finally, the Logistic Regression model performed the worst, with an accuracy of 82.92%. As passenger satisfaction is likely influenced by multiple non-linear and complex factors, a simple linear model is not well-suited for analyzing customer satisfaction. Therefore, this model is not highly recommended to use to predict our target variable.
In general, performances of Neural Network (94.18%) and Random Forest (93.52%) stand out from the other models, highlighting their superior capability to capture complex patterns within the data. The Decision Tree (91.94%) also demonstrates strong performance, which makes it an alternative with an easier interpretation to explain the prediction. In contrast, Logistic Regression (82.92%) and K-NN (85.52%) have relatively low accuracy does not match the effectiveness of tree-based and deep learning models; thus, we will recommend avoiding these 2 models.

From a business point of view, adopting in Neural Networks or Random Forest models can significantly enhance customer insights by accurately predicting passenger satisfaction levels. This enables companies to develop personalized marketing campaigns, offer targeted promotions, and proactively address customer concerns which help improving service quality. The high accuracy of these models allows businesses to make data-driven decisions with confidence, reducing customer dissatisfaction and enhancing the overall customer experience in the competitive market. Moreover, alternative option in Decision Trees provide clear, interpretable insights into why and how predictions are made, making them well-suited for compliance-driven environments and customer service applications where transparency is essential. To enhance model accuracy and reliability in the future, businesses should focus on data quality, feature engineering, and continuous model optimization. High-quality data leads to more precise predictions, while effective feature engineering ensures that models capture the most relevant customer behaviors. By adopting these strategies, companies can make more informed decisions, elevate customer satisfaction, and gain a competitive advantage and rise above the rest in the market.
